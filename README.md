New User Bookings

of **Jupyter Notebooks**. Feel free to contribute to the code or open an issue
if you see something wrong.

Description
-----------

New users on *Airbnb* can book a place to stay in 34,000+ cities across 190+
countries. By accurately predicting where a new user will book their first
travel experience, *Airbnb* can share more personalized content with their
community, decrease the average time to first booking, and better forecast
demand.

In this competition, the objective is to predict in which country a new user
will make his or her first booking. There are **12** possible outcomes of the
destination country and the datasets consists in a list of users with their
demographics, web session records, and some summary statistics.

Due to the [*Competition Rules*][rules], the dataset's can not be shared. If
you want to take a look to the data, head over the [competition][competition]
page and download it.
